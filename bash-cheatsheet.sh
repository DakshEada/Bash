echo $SHELL         # displays the shell you're using
echo $BASH_VERSION  # displays bash version

bash                # if you want to use bash (type exit to go back to your normal shell)
whereis bash        # finds out where bash is on your system


# 1.1. File Commands.


ls                            # lists your files
ls -l                         # lists your files in 'long format', which contains the exact size of the file, who owns the file and who has the right to look at it, and when it was last modified
ls -a                         # lists all files, including hidden files

chmod -options <filename>     # lets you change the read, write, and execute permissions on your files
gzip <filename>               # compresses files
gunzip <filename>             # uncompresses files compressed by gzip
gzcat <filename>              # lets you look at gzipped file without actually having to gunzip it
lpr <filename>                # print the file
lpq                           # check out the printer queue
lprm <jobnumber>              # remove something from the printer queue
genscript                     # converts plain text files into postscript for printing and gives you some options for formatting
dvips <filename>              # print .dvi files (i.e. files produced by LaTeX)
grep <pattern> <filenames>    # looks for the string in the files
grep -r <pattern> <dir>       # search recursively for pattern in directory


# 1.2. Directory Commands.


mkdir <dirname>  # makes a new directory
cd               # changes to home
cd <dirname>     # changes directory
pwd              # tells you where you currently are


# 1.3. SSH, System Info & Network Commands.


ssh user@host            # connects to host as user

finger <user>            # displays information about user
uname -a                 # shows kernel information
man <command>            # shows the manual for specified command
df                       # shows disk usage
du <filename>            # shows the disk usage of the files and directories in filename (du -s give only a total)
last <yourUsername>      # lists your last logins
ps -u yourusername       # lists your processes
kill <PID>               # kills (ends) the processes with the ID you gave
killall <processname>    # kill all processes with the name
top                      # displays your currently active processes
bg                       # lists stopped or background jobs ; resume a stopped job in the background
fg                       # brings the most recent job in the foreground
fg <job>                 # brings job to the foreground

ping <host>              # pings host and outputs results

# 1.4. Shortcuts.


ctrl+c  # halts the current command
ctrl+z  # stops the current command, resume with fg in the foreground or bg in the background
ctrl+d  # logs out of current session, similar to exit
ctrl+w  # erases one word in the current line
ctrl+u  # erases the whole  line
!!      # repeats the last command
exit    # logs out of current session


# 2. Basic Shell Programming.


# 2.1. Variables.


varname=value                # defines a variable
varname=value command        # defines a variable to be in the environment of a particular subprocess
echo $varname                # checks a variable's value
echo $?                      # displays the exit status of the last command
export VARNAME=value         # defines an environment variable (will be available in subprocesses)

${varname:-word}             # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise return word
${varname:=word}             # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise set it word and then return its value
${varname:?message}          # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise print varname, followed by message and abort the current command or script
${varname:+word}             # if varname exists and isn't null, return word; otherwise return null
${varname:offset:length}     # performs substring expansion. It returns the substring of $varname starting at offset and up to length characters

${variable#pattern}          # if the pattern matches the beginning of the variable's value, delete the shortest part that matches and return the rest
${variable##pattern}         # if the pattern matches the beginning of the variable's value, delete the longest part that matches and return the rest
${variable%pattern}          # if the pattern matches the end of the variable's value, delete the shortest part that matches and return the rest
${variable%%pattern}         # if the pattern matches the end of the variable's value, delete the longest part that matches and return the rest
${variable/pattern/string}   # the longest match to pattern in variable is replaced by string. Only the first match is replaced
${variable//pattern/string}  # the longest match to pattern in variable is replaced by string. All matches are replaced

${#varname}                  # returns the length of the value of the variable as a character string

*(patternlist)               # matches zero or more occurences of the given patterns
+(patternlist)               # matches one or more occurences of the given patterns
?(patternlist)               # matches zero or one occurence of the given patterns
@(patternlist)               # matches exactly one of the given patterns
!(patternlist)               # matches anything except one of the given patterns

$(UNIX command)              # command substitution: runs the command and returns standard output


# 2.2. Functions.
# The function refers to passed arguments by position (as if they were positional parameters), that is, $1, $2, and so forth.
# $@ is equal to "$1" "$2"... "$N", where N is the number of positional paramaters. $# holds the number of positional parameters.


functname() {
  shell commands
}

unset -f functname  # deletes a function definition
declare -f          # displays all defined functions in your login session


# 2.3. Flow Control.


statement1 && statement2  # and operator
statement1 || statement2  # or operator

-a                        # and operator inside a test conditional expression
-o                        # or operator inside a test conditional expression

str1=str2                 # str1 matches str2
str1!=str2                # str1 does not match str2
str1<str2                 # str1 is less than str2
str1>str2                 # str1 is greater than str2
-n str1                   # str1 is not null (has length greater than 0)
-z str1                   # str1 is null (has length 0)

-a file                   # file exists

-e file                   # file exists; same -a
-f file                   # file exists and is a regular file (i.e., not a directory or other special type of file)
-r file                   # you have read permission
-r file                   # file exists and is not empty
-w file                   # your have write permission
-x file                   # you have execute permission on file, or directory search permission if it is a directory
-N file                   # file was modified since it was last read
-O file                   # you own file
-G file                   # file's group ID matches yours (or one of yours, if you are in multiple groups)
file1 -nt file2           # file1 is newer than file2
file1 -ot file2           # file1 is older than file2

-lt                       # less than
-le                       # less than or equal
-eq                       # equal
