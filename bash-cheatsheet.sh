# 1.1. File Commands.


ls                            # lists your files
ls -l                         # lists your files in 'long format', which contains the exact size of the file, who owns the file and who has the right to look at it, and when it was last modified
ls -a                         # lists all files, including hidden files
ln -s <filename> <link>       # creates symbolic link to file
touch <filename>              # creates or updates your file
cat > <filename>              # places standard input into file
more <filename>               # shows the first part of a file (move with space and type q to quit)
head <filename>               # outputs the first 10 lines of file

chmod -options <filename>     # lets you change the read, write, and execute permissions on your files
gzip <filename>               # compresses files
gunzip <filename>             # uncompresses files compressed by gzip
gzcat <filename>              # lets you look at gzipped file without actually having to gunzip it
lpr <filename>                # print the file
lpq                           # check out the printer queue

genscript                     # converts plain text files into postscript for printing and gives you some options for formatting
dvips <filename>              # print .dvi files (i.e. files produced by LaTeX)
grep <pattern> <filenames>    # looks for the string in the files
grep -r <pattern> <dir>       # search recursively for pattern in directory


# 1.2. Directory Commands.


mkdir <dirname>  # makes a new directory

ctrl+u  # erases the whole  line
!!      # repeats the last command
exit    # log out of current session


# 2. Basic Shell Programming.


# 2.1. Variables.


varname=value          # define a variable
varname=value command  # define a variable to be in the environment of a particular subprocess
echo $varname          # check a variable's value
export VARNAME=value   # define an environment variable

${varname:-word}       # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise return word
${varname:=word}       # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise set it word and then return its value
${varname:?message}    # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise print varname, followed by message and abort the current command or script


# 2.2. Functions.
# The function refers to passed arguments by position (as if they were positional parameters), that is, $1, $2, and so forth.
# $@ is equal to "$1" "$2"... "$N", where N is the number of positional paramaters. $# holds the number of positional parameters.


functname() {
  shell commands
}

unset -f functname  # deletes a function definition
declare -f          # displays all defined functions in your login session


# 3. Tips and Tricks.


# set an alias
cd; nano .bashrc
> alias gentlenode='ssh admin@gentlenode.com -p 3404'  # add you alias in .bash_profile

# to quickly go to a specific directory
cd; nano .bashrc
> shopt -s cdable_vars
> websites="/Users/mac/Documents/websites"

source .bashrc
cd websites
